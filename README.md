# Data-Visualisation-using-Tableau
Using the Tableau BI tool i did some data analysis based on the HR core dataset from a company called Dental Magic.Since the data set contained a lot of cloumns/fields i only used specific fileds such as  gender, citizenDesc,HireDate.TerminationDate,Reason Termination,Employee status which checks if the employee is either (active,future start,voluntarily terminated,termination for cause and leave of absence), then i also included the different departments that are available at the company and later on started with my analysis. I firstly dealt with the demographics were i checked the number of people in the company both male and female,the type of citizen that each employee is and later on check their status if whether or not they still working at the company. I compared the trends for the hiring and firing at the company from the year 2010 to 2016 and tried to figure out why they were fired. My end result was determining or rather displaying all the people that were fired in all departments separated by gender and figured out which gender experienced the most termination for cause.
